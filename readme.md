# Kite Filter Client
What is the Kite Filter Client?\
It's Simple! It's just the Kite Filter Chrome Extension

## Installation
```bash
# In your Chromium based broweser go to chrome://extensions
# And enable "Developer Mode"
$ git clone https://github.com/entrpix/kite-filter-client.git
# Then Drag-n-Drop the kite-filter-client folder onto the page
```

## Permissions
Why does Kite have so many permissions?\
Thats what I'm here to answer!
- `scripting, activeTab`
    - Filtering / Site-Blocking
- `identity, history`
    - History Monitoring / Reporting
- `downloads, bookmarks, pageCapture`
    - Exploit Prevention
- The two other APIs (`storage, alarms`) are just useful developer features
